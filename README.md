# HTTP Status Code Checker

dead simple binary to check http status code returned from health-check
endpoint.

## Why not just use cURL?

cURL can definitively do the job as long as you are willing to mix the shell
script to parse the payload. Specially if you want to cover a range of status
instead of a single HTTP code.

The `http_status_code_check` command removes the necessity of parsing the HTTP
status codes and let you dealing only with the program exit code itself:
- 0 - if the status code is inside the list of expected ones
- 1 - if the status code is outside the list of expected ones

## Install

`cargo install http_status_code_check`

## Usage

- Checking for single code:

`http_status_code_check -u http://google.com -s 200`

- Checking for multiple codes:

`http_status_code_check -u http://google.com -s 201,200`
